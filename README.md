I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Glasgow, and right now I'm also a technology developer intern at Barclays. I love working with software, code and people. I'm currently working on my internship, but also an Angular website for the University of Glasgow Book Society. Other than that, I've got some experience in Java, Python, and always looking to learn something new.
